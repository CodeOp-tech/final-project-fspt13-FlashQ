# FlashQ - quick as a ⚡

# Summary

**FlashQ** is an app for students that guarantees a dynamic and fun method to study by creating flashcards with questions and answers to any of topic of interest. With this gamified learning app you can decide when and where to put your knowledge to a test.

By adding a time-restraint component the engagement with the subjects at hand increases, as you strive your best to get the answer before it's revealed.

## Motivation and descriptions

We have found that it's necessary to learn in a fun way, so we decided to develop an app that encourages a different way of learning.

Make your own questions and answers in flashcards and pratice any kind of subject on the go.

We know that there are several ways to learn something, however, by creating your own flashcards, you are free to choose the best way for you. We know what it's like to have time pressure due to work or family duties, we think this should not come in the way of dedicating time to your personal development.

Being able to customize the questions and answers in different subjects is a unique feature of our app. By having to chose the specific wording of both questions and anwswer you start your learning journey already from the conceptions of the materials.

FlashQ is:

➡ **Easy**

➡ **Handy**

➡ **Fun!**
