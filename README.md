## SUMMARY

FlashQ is an app for students that need a dynamic and fun method to study. In this case, by creating flashcards with questions and answers to any of your topics of interest. After creating your selection of questions it's time to put your knowledge to a test. By adding a time-restraint component the engagement with the subjects at hand increases, as you strive your best to get the answer before it's revealed.

MOTIVATION AND DESCRIPTION
We have found that it's necessary to learn in a fun way, so we decided to develop an app that encourages a different way of learning, by making your own questions and answers in flashcards to be able to pratice any kind of subject.
We know that there are several ways to learn something, but by creating your own flashcards, you are free to choose the best way for you.
Being able to customize the questions and answers in different subjects is a unique feature of our app. By having to chose the specific wording of both questions and anwswer you start your learning journey already from the conceptions of the materials.
